# FontPadding

There are basically font paddings depending on the font-size and line-height.
If it is on the PC, you can capture the browser and immediately check Photoshop and other tools.
But Mobile is difficult to confirm. So I made it.

## Usage

### Add my markup project code
```js
<script src="https://joontop.github.io/FontPadding/build/font-padding1.0.0.js"></script>
```

### Run browser console

```js
var script = document.createElement('script');
script.src = 'https://joontop.github.io/FontPadding/build/font-padding1.0.0.js';
document.querySelector('body').appendChild(script);
```
